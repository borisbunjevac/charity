# charity
I designed a page according to one I foun on your link (web site). I used the icons I could get (font awesome). I could easily use others, if I had them. If I had more time, I would have done the tasks differently, it concennes especially the bonus task. When I finished CSS/HTML, the time was up. No time for Drupal.
